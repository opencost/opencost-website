# OpenCost Setup

There are several supported ways of deploying OpenCost, depending on your use case and environment. Each cloud provider has different configuration requirements depending on your deployment. For full OpenCost functionality (Kubernetes Cost Allocations, Cloud Costs, and the web UI), we recommend deploying with Helm and following the instructions specific to your cloud provider:
* [Amazon Web Services](../configuration/aws)
* [Microsoft Azure](../configuration/azure)
* [Google Cloud Platform](../configuration/gcp)
* [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](../configuration/oracle)
* [On-premises deployments](../configuration/on-prem)
* [Docker (no Kubernetes support)](docker)

## Requirements

OpenCost requires a Kubernetes cluster to be deployed. Users should be running Kubernetes 1.21+ and Kubernetes 1.28 is officially supported as of v1.105.

OpenCost requires [Prometheus](prometheus) for scraping metrics and data storage.

## Accessing OpenCost

Once your OpenCost has been installed, wait for the pods to be ready and port forward with:

```sh
kubectl port-forward --namespace opencost service/opencost 9003 9090
```

To verify that the UI and server are running, you may connect to the OpenCost UI at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).

To verify that the server is running, access [http://localhost:9003/allocation/compute?window=60m](http://localhost:9003/allocation/compute?window=60m)

### Accessing OpenCost Data

Beyond the OpenCost UI, you may access the cost monitoring data for OpenCost through:
* [OpenCost API](../integrations/api) and [API examples](../integrations/api-examples)
* [kubectl cost](../integrations/kubectl-cost) plugin
* [CSV Exports](../integrations/csv-export)
* [Parquet Exports](../integrations/parquet-export)

## Updating OpenCost

Depending on how you installed OpenCost, it may be a matter of updating the [Helm chart](helm) to the latest version or updating the version number in your `values.yaml` or manifest. Data is stored in Prometheus, so upgrading/downgrading should not impact the recorded data.

## Uninstalling OpenCost

Depending on how you installed OpenCost, you may uninstall the release and delete the `opencost` namespace.
```
$ helm uninstall opencost
$ kubectl delete namespace opencost
```
If you wish to delete the Prometheus data, uninstall the release and delete the `prometheus-server` namespace.
```
$ helm uninstall prometheus
$ kubectl delete namespace prometheus-system
```

If you installed with the manifest, enter the following command:

`kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencost/opencost/develop/kubernetes/opencost.yaml`
