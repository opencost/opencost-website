# OpenCost Setup

There are several supported ways of deploying OpenCost, depending on your use case and environment. Each cloud provider has different configuration requirements depending on your deployment. For full OpenCost functionality (Kubernetes Cost Allocations, Cloud Costs, and the web UI), we recommend deploying with Helm and following the instructions specific to your cloud provider:
* [Amazon Web Services](../configuration/aws)
* [Microsoft Azure](../configuration/azure)
* [Google Cloud Platform](../configuration/gcp)
* [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](../configuration/oracle)
* [On-premises deployments](../configuration/on-prem)
* [Docker (no Kubernetes support)](docker)

## Requirements

OpenCost requires a Kubernetes cluster to be deployed. Users should be running Kubernetes 1.21+ and Kubernetes 1.28 is officially supported as of v1.105.

OpenCost requires [Prometheus](prometheus) for scraping metrics and data storage.

## Accessing OpenCost

Once your OpenCost has been installed, wait for the pods to be ready and port forward with:

```sh
kubectl port-forward --namespace opencost service/opencost 9003 9090
```

To verify that the UI and server are running, you may connect to the OpenCost UI at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).

To verify that the server is running, access [http://localhost:9003/allocation/compute?window=60m](http://localhost:9003/allocation/compute?window=60m)

### Data Access

Beyond the OpenCost UI, you may access the cost monitoring data for OpenCost through:
* [OpenCost API](../integrations/api) and [API examples](../integrations/api-examples)
* [kubectl cost](../integrations/kubectl-cost) plugin
* [CSV Exports](../integrations/csv-export)
* [Parquet Exports](../integrations/parquet-export)

## Updating OpenCost
To update your OpenCost to the most recent version, using a previously unmodified `opencost.yaml` manifest, enter the following command. This will update OpenCost to the latest version.

```sh
kubectl -n opencost rollout restart deployment
```

To check logs to verify the version of your OpenCost:

```sh
$  kubectl logs -n opencost deployment/opencost | head
2022-09-02T18:20:34.327989163Z ??? Log level set to info
2022-09-02T18:20:34.328206357Z INF Starting cost-model (git commit "x.xx.x")
```

### Sidegrading OpenCost
If you wish to modify OpenCost to a previous version, start with the following command in order to modify the `opencost.yaml` manifest:

In the line `quay.io/kubecost1/kubecost-cost-model:latest`, change `latest` to the desired version number in the format `prod-x.xx.x`. Then enter the following command to apply the updated `opencost.yaml` manifest:

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f opencost.yaml -n opencost
namespace/opencost unchanged
serviceaccount/opencost unchanged
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/opencost unchanged
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/opencost unchanged
deployment.apps/opencost configured
service/opencost unchanged
```

Finally, check the logs to verify the version of your OpenCost has successfully been changed:

```sh
$  kubectl logs -n opencost deployment/opencost | head
2022-09-02T18:20:34.327989163Z ??? Log level set to info
2022-09-02T18:20:34.328206357Z INF Starting cost-model (git commit "x.xx.x")
```

## Deleting OpenCost
To delete OpenCost, enter the following command:

`kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencost/opencost/develop/kubernetes/opencost.yaml`
