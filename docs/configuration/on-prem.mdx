# Installing On-Premises (on-prem)

OpenCost may be installed on-prem and provides default pricing that may be overridden.

## On-Prem Configuration

On-prem cluster pricing is supported in OpenCost by providing default prices for node data via the [default.json](https://github.com/opencost/opencost/blob/develop/configs/default.json). Here are the default prices:

```json
{
    "provider": "custom",
    "description": "Default prices based on GCP us-central1",
    "CPU": "0.031611",
    "spotCPU": "0.006655",
    "RAM": "0.004237",
    "spotRAM": "0.000892",
    "GPU": "0.95",
    "storage": "0.00005479452",
    "zoneNetworkEgress": "0.01",
    "regionNetworkEgress": "0.01",
    "internetNetworkEgress": "0.12"
}
```

### Custom pricing using the OpenCost Helm Chart

Custom pricing may be applied by updating your OpenCost Helm chart's local values file. Any values not overridden will default to the values provided by the Helm chart, which match those in the [default.json](https://github.com/opencost/opencost/blob/develop/configs/default.json).

```yaml
opencost:
  customPricing:
    enabled: true
    costModel:
      description: Modified prices based on your internal pricing
      CPU: 1.25
      RAM: 0.50
      storage: 0.25
```

The values in the example above will be reflected in the OpenCost with substantially higher CPU, RAM, and PV costs compared to the default pricing.

## On-Prem Cloud Costs
