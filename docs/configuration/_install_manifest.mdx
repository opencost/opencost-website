For basic Kubernetes Cost Allocations _without_ Cloud Costs or any customizations you may use the OpenCost manifest. Prometheus is still required and the Helm chart installation is recommended for anything beyond this simple use case.

```sh
kubectl apply --namespace opencost -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencost/opencost/develop/kubernetes/opencost.yaml
```
