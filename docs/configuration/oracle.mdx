# Installing on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

OpenCost may be installed on Kubernetes clusters running on OCI or on the Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE).
<Installing/>

## Installing Prometheus

<InstallPrometheus/>
<CustomPrometheus/>

## OCI Configuration

### Cost Allocation

OpenCost will automatically detect OCI as the cloud service provider (CSP) by reading node information from `node.spec.providerID`. When OCI is detected as the CSP, OpenCost attempts to retrieve pricing data from the [OCI Price List API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingup_topic-Estimating_Costs.htm#accessing_list_pricing).

No API key is required to retrieve the public pricing data.

:::note

If your cluster is an OKE cluster, OpenCost will apply enhanced cluster pricing by default.
