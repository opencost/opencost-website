# Installing on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

OpenCost may be installed on Kubernetes clusters running on OCI or on the Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE). You will need to install Prometheus, configure your cluster, and then install OpenCost.

## Installing Prometheus

<InstallPrometheus/>

<CustomPrometheus/>

## OCI Configuration

### Cost Allocation

OpenCost will automatically detect OCI as the cloud service provider (CSP) by reading node information from `node.spec.providerID`. When OCI is detected as the CSP, OpenCost attempts to retrieve pricing data from the [OCI Price List API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingup_topic-Estimating_Costs.htm#accessing_list_pricing).

No API key is required to retrieve the public pricing data.

:::note

If your cluster is an OKE cluster, OpenCost will apply enhanced cluster pricing by default.
