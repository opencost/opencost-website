# Overview

OpenCost is a vendor-neutral open source project for measuring and allocating cloud infrastructure and container costs. Itâ€™s built for Kubernetes cost monitoring to power real-time cost monitoring, showback, and chargeback.

Below are common documentation pages for the OpenCost Project:

## Installation

Check out our [Installation guide](installation/install) to start monitoring and managing your spend in minutes. Additional documentation is available for [configuring Prometheus](installation/prometheus) and managing your [OpenCost with Helm](installation/helm).

## Integrating Cloud Costs and Configuration

If you want more accurate results or Cloud Costs from your provider's bill please refer to the [Integrating Cloud Costs and Configuration](configuration/) page or jump directly to your cloud-specific configuration:

* [Amazon Web Services](configuration/aws)
* [Microsoft Azure](configuration/azure)
* [Google Cloud Platform](configuration/gcp)
* [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](configuration/oracle)
* [On-Premises](configuration/on-prem)
* Alibaba - **documentation needed**
* Scaleway - **documentation needed**

## Specification

The [OpenCost Specification](specification) describes a vendor-neutral implementation for Kubernetes cost monitoring.

## Using the UI

The OpenCost UI provides a visualization of the Kubernetes allocations and the related Cloud Costs. This walkthrough highlights some of the components of the [OpenCost UI](installation/ui).
