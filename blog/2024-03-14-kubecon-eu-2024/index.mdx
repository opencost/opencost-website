To kick things off on Tuesday there will be a Project Lightning Talk [Monitoring Kubernetes and Cloud Spend with OpenCost](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1aQWQ/monitoring-kubernetes-and-cloud-spend-with-opencost-project-lightning-talk?iframe=no) at 10:00 am in Pavilion 7, Level 7.1 Room D. This will be a introduction to OpenCost as a foundation for monitoring Kubernetes and cloud costs. There will be opportunities to follow up after the session, so introduce yourself and we can talk about the project afterwards.

OpenCost will be in the [Project Pavilion](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/project-engagement/#project-pavilion) on Wednesday 3:00-8:00pm and Friday 12:30-2:30pm in Kiosk PP11-B. Stop by with your questions, grab some stickers and other swag, or just drop in to discuss the latest news in the OpenCost community. All OpenCost community members are welcome to spend some time at the kiosk.

There has been a lot of new development and features launched since [KubeCon NA 2023](https://www.opencost.io/blog/kubecon-na-2023), we're eager to talk about some major new features that we'll be discussing at KubeCon EU. We'll be involved with a number of discussions at the event, interviews, and attending sessions. If you want to catch up at KubeCon EU, you can drop an email at opencost-kubecost@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com or reach out in Slack. It's going to be a great week, see you there!
